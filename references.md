This project was refactored as part of a security-focused learning exercise with the assistance of **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**.  
AI guidance was used to:

- Identify and document key security vulnerabilities, including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, and weak password hashing.
- Recommend and implement modern best practices such as `bcrypt` for secure password storage, parameterized SQL queries, and environment variable configuration.
- Improve code documentation, structure, and logging practices following industry standards.
